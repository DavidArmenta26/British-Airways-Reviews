# BRITISH AIRWAYS REVIWES 
The purpose of this dashboard is to analyze and visualize the ratings of different aspects of British Airwaysâ€™ service, allowing users to identify trends, compare performance across different categories, and gain valuable insights into customer satisfaction.


## Structure
In the Datasets folder, we find the .csv files obtained for the analysis. These are:

- ba_reviews: This dataset contains important metrics evaluated by the users, as well as relevant information about the users who wrote the reviews.
- Countries: This dataset was used to apply various filters on the dashboard, as it divides the world by continent, region, code, and, of course, country.

The British Airways Review file contains the dashboard created in Tableau.

## Analysis
Entertainment is the lowest-rated metric by users, with notably low and even negative ratings. It is noteworthy that no aircraft reached a rating of 4.0 or higher in this metric, unlike the others, where at least one aircraft surpassed this rating.

Regarding Overall Rating, there is an upward trend observed from 2016, peaking in 2020, followed by a downward trend until the latest records available in 2023.

The highest-rated aircraft is the A350, but it only has four reviews, which may not be entirely reliable. The next highest-rated is the Boeing 747-400, with 13 reviews, though it is worth mentioning that data for this aircraft is only available until April 2020.

The aircraft with the highest number of reviews is the A320, with 34 reviews, ranking number 11 in the Overall Rating. For this aircraft, the lowest-rated metric is Entertainment, with an average of -0.5.

The highest-rated seat type is First Class, with an Overall Rating of 4.4. In this seat type, the lowest metric remains Entertainment, with an average of 2.7, almost double the general average (1.7) for all seat types.

The line graph shows significant fluctuations in the average monthly ratings from 2016 to 2023, with several notable peaks and drops.

## Conclusions

The dashboard provides a clear and detailed view of customer satisfaction across different aspects of British Airways' service. Although the overall rating is high, there are specific areas, such as entertainment, that require improvements.

- **Improve In-Flight Entertainment**: Focusing efforts in this area could significantly increase customer satisfaction.
  
- **A350 Analysis**: Conducting a deeper analysis of the services offered on the A350 could help identify successful practices that can be replicated on other aircraft.
  
- **Service Optimization**: Based on the data from the highest-rated aircraft and seat types, improvements can be implemented across the entire fleet to enhance the customer experience.
